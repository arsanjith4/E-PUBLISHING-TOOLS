AIM:

	To create a pencil sketch of an image by applying various filters and blending modes.

PROCEDURE:

	1.Open an image that has some decent edge details.
	2.Go to Image → Adjustments → Desaturate. This converts the image into grayscale.
	3.Right-click on the desaturated layer and select Duplicate Layer.
	4.Go to Image → Adjustments → Invert. This will invert the duplicated layer.
	5.In the Layers panel, change the blending mode from Normal to Linear Dodge. You should see a perfectly white image.
	6.Go to Filter → Blur → Gaussian Blur. The Gaussian Blur dialog box appears.
	7.Adjust the radius slider until you get a pencil sketch effect. Then click OK. Linear Dodge produces a softer result.
	8.After inverting, change the blending mode from Normal to Color Dodge.
	9.Then go to Filter → Blur → Gaussian Blur.
	10.Adjust the slider until you get a pencil sketch effect. Then click OK. Color Dodge produces sharper edges.
	11.Go to File → Save As and save the pencil sketch in PSD format.
	12.Close the program.

RESULT:

	Thus, a pencil sketch of the image is successfully created by applying various filters and blending modes.
