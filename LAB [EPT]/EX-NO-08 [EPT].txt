					LAYER MASKING

AIM:

	To create a design with the use of a layer mask using two images as back-ground and foreground.

PROCEDURE:

	1.Create a new document.
	2.Open the two images you want to combine (e.g., Sky and Birds).
	3.Select the first image (Birds), choose the Move Tool, and drag it into the new document. This becomes Layer 1.
	4.Repeat the process for the second image (Sky). This becomes Layer 2.

ADDING A LAYER MASK:

	5. Select the top image layer (Sky) in the Layers panel.
	6. Click the Add Layer Mask button. This adds a white layer mask. White reveals the layer, black hides it.

PAINTING ON THE LAYER MASK:

	7. Ensure the layer mask thumbnail has a white border. If not, click the thumbnail to select it.
	8. Select the Brush Tool and set the desired brush size and hardness.
	9. Press D to reset foreground/background colors, then X to switch between black (hide) and white (reveal).
	10. Paint with black over areas to hide (e.g., hide parts of Sky to show Birds).
	11. If you hide too much, paint with white to reveal hidden areas.
	12. Zoom in for final adjustments, resizing the brush as needed.

SAVING YOUR WORK:

	13. Save the file in .PSD format to retain layers and layer masks for future editing.

RESULT:

	Thus, a design is created with the use of a layer mask using two images as background and foreground.
